There are numerous scientific and engineering considerations that would come into play in deciding what research a lunar rover will conduct, including where it will land. Scientists use imaging data from satellites orbiting the moon to learn about its surface and guide their decision-making to choose scientifically significant landing sites.

Specific goal for this mission is put to work rover to find/extract iced water. We learn about possible handicaps on zone were was detected: evaluate better zones and times in diary journeys to recharge with photovoltaic absortion (LOLA measurement), deal in shadow times with low temperatures, choose the best path for the orography defined by Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO).

First part of problem was to determine a safe zone to land, as close as possible to the ice water that was detected when In October 2017, LCROSS was ordered to impact a shaded region permanently near the lunar south pole, which resulted in the discovery of water ice.

Analyzing the available data by LRO, the landing zone can not be the same with the places where the ice water is, since these places correspond to deep places in the South Pole, where the light does not usually enter through the unevenness of the terrain. The rover depends on sunlight to externd its mission, and current technology is not ready, especially batteries, to work at such low temperatures for a period of time without additional energy expense.
